title: About Me
description: Learn more about my journey as a Principal Frontend Engineer specializing in accessibility infrastructure, testing tools, and open source development.
content: |
  Hi, I'm **Tony Kornmeier**, a Principal Frontend Engineer and Open Source Contributor based in Maumee, OH. For over a decade, I've been passionate about building developer tools that make the web more accessible for everyone.<br /><br />

  My work focuses on creating testing infrastructure that developers actually love to use. I'm the creator and lead maintainer of the **CAT (Component Accessibility Testing) Framework**, an observer-based testing framework that seamlessly integrates with Playwright, Cypress, and WebdriverIO to provide continuous accessibility monitoring during test execution.

  ### My Journey

  I currently lead accessibility infrastructure development at **Fidelity Investments**, where I build enterprise-scale developer tools for over 10,000 developers. Before that, I spent seven years at **Deque Systems**, the industry leader in accessibility solutions, where I progressed from leading development services projects to managing product teams building enterprise accessibility dashboards and testing tools.

  ### My Philosophy

  I believe the best developer tools are ones that integrate seamlessly into existing workflows with zero friction. Whether it's designing APIs, architecting plugin systems, or building browser extensions, my focus is always on creating tools that provide immediate value while being easy to adopt and maintain.<br /><br />

  Great accessibility testing shouldn't require developers to change how they work—it should enhance their existing processes. That's why I focus on building solutions that use familiar patterns like dependency injection, plugin architectures, and observer patterns to deliver powerful capabilities without complexity.

  ### What Drives Me

  What keeps me excited about this work is the intersection of three things I'm passionate about:

  - **Developer Experience**: Creating tools with thoughtful API design and comprehensive documentation that developers actually enjoy using
  - **Accessibility**: Making the web more inclusive by building infrastructure that makes accessibility testing as easy as possible
  - **Open Source**: Contributing back to the community and helping others solve similar challenges

  Currently, I'm researching and prototyping a **Storybook Accessibility Addon** that will bring real-time accessibility feedback to component-driven development workflows, inspired by successful freemium models in the ecosystem.

  ### Technical Expertise

  My technical toolkit centers around TypeScript and modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, Web Components). I specialize in:

  - Building testing infrastructure with Playwright, Cypress, and WebdriverIO
  - Component-driven development with Storybook
  - Monorepo architecture using Turborepo and PNPM workspaces
  - Browser extension development
  - Plugin architecture and API design
  - CI/CD integration and automation

  ### Beyond the Code

  When I'm not building developer tools or contributing to open source projects, I enjoy golf, cycling, and spending time with my family.<br /><br />
