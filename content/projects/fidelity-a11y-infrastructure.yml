title: Fidelity Accessibility Infrastructure
description: When you're building tools for 10,000+ developers, you learn quickly that if it's not easy, it won't get used. I led the effort to bake accessibility testing directly into Fidelity's CI/CD pipelines and built a browser-based monitoring tool that gives developers instant feedback. The best part? Watching teams across different business units adopt the component patterns we created. Turns out making accessibility easy is the key to making it universal.
