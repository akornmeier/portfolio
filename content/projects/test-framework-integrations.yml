title: Test Framework Integrations & Extensions
description: Over the years, I've built a collection of accessibility testing integrations for the tools developers actually use. Test wrappers for Playwright and Cypress, a browser extension (WXT + Vue) for real-time feedback while you code, component linters for Vue, Angular, and Lit. Each one solves a specific pain point I've seen teams struggle with. It's all about meeting developers where they already are instead of forcing them to adopt new workflows.
